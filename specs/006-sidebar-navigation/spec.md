# Feature Specification: Sidebar Navigation System

**Feature Branch**: `006-sidebar-navigation`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "添加一个侧边栏的功能,虚拟试衣是其中一个功能"

## Overview

This feature introduces a persistent sidebar navigation system that consolidates all major application features into a single, accessible navigation panel. The virtual try-on feature is one of multiple features accessible through this sidebar, creating a unified user experience across the application.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Basic Sidebar Navigation (Priority: P1)

Users can access a sidebar menu that displays all available features in the application. The sidebar remains accessible throughout the user's session, allowing quick navigation between different features without returning to a home page.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational MVP - without a working sidebar, users cannot navigate to any features. It delivers immediate value by improving navigation efficiency and providing a consistent navigation pattern across the application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking the sidebar toggle button and verifying that the sidebar opens/closes with a list of navigation items. Delivers value by providing instant access to all application features from any page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user on any page, **When** they click the sidebar toggle button, **Then** the sidebar opens and displays all available navigation items
2. **Given** an open sidebar, **When** the user clicks the toggle button again or clicks outside the sidebar, **Then** the sidebar closes smoothly
3. **Given** an open sidebar, **When** the user clicks on a navigation item, **Then** they are navigated to the corresponding feature page and the sidebar closes (on mobile) or remains open (on desktop)
4. **Given** a user on a specific feature page, **When** they view the sidebar, **Then** the current page's navigation item is visually highlighted

### User Story 2 - Virtual Try-On Integration (Priority: P2)

Users can navigate to the virtual try-on feature through the sidebar navigation. The virtual try-on feature is clearly labeled and easily accessible among other features.

**Why this priority**: This connects the new navigation system with existing functionality. While important, it depends on the basic sidebar (P1) being functional first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the sidebar and clicking the virtual try-on menu item, then verifying successful navigation to the try-on interface. Delivers value by making the virtual try-on feature more discoverable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user with the sidebar open, **When** they click the "Virtual Try-On" navigation item, **Then** they are taken to the virtual try-on page
2. **Given** a user already on the virtual try-on page, **When** they open the sidebar, **Then** the "Virtual Try-On" item is visually highlighted as the current page
3. **Given** a user navigating from another feature to virtual try-on, **When** the page loads, **Then** all virtual try-on functionality (model upload, clothing selection, try-on process) works as expected

### User Story 3 - Collapsible Sidebar on Desktop (Priority: P3)

Desktop users can collapse the sidebar to gain more screen space for content while still seeing icon-only navigation. The sidebar remembers the user's preference (expanded or collapsed) across sessions.

**Why this priority**: This is an enhancement for user experience but not critical for basic functionality. Users can still access all features with a fully expanded sidebar.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking a collapse button in the sidebar, verifying it shrinks to show only icons, and checking that the preference persists after page reload. Delivers value by giving users control over their workspace layout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a desktop user with an expanded sidebar, **When** they click the collapse button, **Then** the sidebar transitions to a collapsed state showing only icons
2. **Given** a collapsed sidebar, **When** the user hovers over an icon, **Then** a tooltip displays the full name of the feature
3. **Given** a user who has set a sidebar preference (expanded/collapsed), **When** they reload the page or return later, **Then** the sidebar opens in their preferred state
4. **Given** a collapsed sidebar, **When** the user clicks an icon, **Then** they navigate to that feature

### User Story 4 - Responsive Mobile Sidebar (Priority: P2)

Mobile users can access the sidebar through a hamburger menu button. The sidebar opens as a full-screen overlay on mobile devices and automatically closes after navigation to prevent obscuring content.

**Why this priority**: Mobile usability is critical for accessibility, but this depends on the basic sidebar structure (P1) being in place first. It's prioritized equally with virtual try-on integration (P2) as both are essential for complete functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening the application on a mobile device, tapping the hamburger menu, and verifying the sidebar opens as an overlay. Delivers value by making navigation accessible on all device sizes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a mobile user on any page, **When** they tap the hamburger menu button, **Then** the sidebar opens as a full-screen overlay
2. **Given** an open mobile sidebar, **When** the user taps outside the sidebar or on a navigation item, **Then** the sidebar closes automatically
3. **Given** a mobile user with the sidebar open, **When** they tap a navigation item, **Then** they are navigated to the feature and the sidebar closes immediately
4. **Given** a mobile device in landscape orientation, **When** the sidebar opens, **Then** it adjusts its width appropriately for the screen size

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user is on a page that doesn't have a corresponding sidebar item (e.g., a settings page)? → No item is highlighted, but sidebar remains functional
- How does the system handle a user clicking rapidly between multiple sidebar items? → Navigation should debounce to prevent multiple simultaneous page loads
- What happens if the user's screen is extremely narrow (less than 320px)? → Sidebar should adapt to show minimum viable navigation
- How does the sidebar behave during feature loading (when navigating between pages)? → Show loading indicator if navigation takes more than 500ms
- What happens if a user has disabled JavaScript? → Sidebar should degrade gracefully with server-side rendering fallback
- How does the sidebar handle deep-linked URLs (user enters URL directly)? → Sidebar should initialize with correct active item based on current route

## Requirements

### Key Entities

- **Navigation Item**: Represents a feature or page in the application
  - Properties: Label (display name), Route (URL path), Icon (visual identifier), Active state (whether currently selected), Order (position in menu)

- **Sidebar State**: Tracks the current state of the sidebar for a user session
  - Properties: Open/Closed status, Expanded/Collapsed preference (desktop only), Active item ID, Device type (mobile/desktop)

- **User Preference**: Stores persistent user choices about sidebar behavior
  - Properties: User ID, Preferred sidebar state (expanded/collapsed for desktop), Last updated timestamp

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can access any feature in the application within 2 clicks (open sidebar + click feature) from any page
- **SC-002**: Sidebar opens and closes with smooth animation completing in under 300ms
- **SC-003**: 90% of users successfully navigate to their desired feature on first attempt using the sidebar
- **SC-004**: Mobile sidebar overlay covers 100% of viewport width and does not interfere with page content when closed
- **SC-005**: Desktop collapsed sidebar occupies no more than 64px of horizontal space while showing all navigation icons
- **SC-006**: Sidebar state preference (expanded/collapsed) persists correctly across page reloads and browser sessions for 95% of users
- **SC-007**: All sidebar interactions (open, close, navigate) respond within 100ms of user action
- **SC-008**: Sidebar navigation items are keyboard-accessible and screen-reader friendly, meeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards

## Assumptions

- The application already has routing infrastructure in place to handle navigation between pages
- User authentication is already implemented, so we can safely assume a logged-in user context
- The existing virtual try-on feature has a dedicated route/page that can be linked from the sidebar
- Desktop users prefer having a persistent sidebar for quick access, while mobile users prefer maximizing content space
- Standard sidebar width is 240-280px when expanded, 64px when collapsed (icon-only)
- Mobile breakpoint is 768px (following common responsive design conventions)
- User preferences can be stored in browser local storage or user profile (if backend support exists)
- The sidebar should integrate with existing application theme/design system

## Out of Scope

- Multi-level nested navigation (submenus within sidebar items)
- Sidebar customization (allowing users to rearrange or hide menu items)
- Sidebar search functionality
- Recently accessed features section
- Notification badges on sidebar items
- Dark mode toggle in sidebar (should be handled separately in settings)
- User profile management beyond basic display (avatar/name)
- Role-based menu item visibility (all authenticated users see all items)
