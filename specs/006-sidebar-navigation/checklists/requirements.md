- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Details

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. No mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches.

✅ **User value focused**: Each user story explicitly states why it matters and the value it delivers to users.

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language describing user interactions and business outcomes rather than technical architecture.

✅ **Mandatory sections**: All required sections are present and complete:
- User Scenarios & Testing (with 4 prioritized user stories)
- Requirements (15 functional requirements, 3 key entities)
- Success Criteria (8 measurable outcomes)

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: Specification makes informed assumptions about standard sidebar behavior based on industry conventions. All ambiguities are resolved in the Assumptions section.

✅ **Testable requirements**: All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) use clear, testable language with MUST statements that can be verified.

Examples:
- FR-002: "System MUST provide a toggle mechanism (button) to open and close the sidebar" - Can test by clicking toggle
- FR-008: "System MUST display the sidebar as a full-screen overlay on mobile devices (viewport width < 768px)" - Can test with responsive design tools

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "within 2 clicks" - Quantifiable
- SC-002: "under 300ms" - Measurable time
- SC-003: "90% of users" - Percentage metric
- SC-006: "95% of users" - Percentage metric

✅ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes without mentioning implementation:
- ✓ "Sidebar opens and closes with smooth animation" (not "CSS transition completes")
- ✓ "Users can access any feature within 2 clicks" (not "React Router navigates")
- ✓ "Sidebar navigation items are keyboard-accessible" (not "implements onKeyDown handlers")

✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each user story has 3-4 Given-When-Then scenarios covering:
- Happy path (normal usage)
- Edge cases (mobile/desktop differences, state persistence)
- Visual feedback (highlighting current page)

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 6 edge cases documented covering:
- Missing navigation items
- Rapid clicking
- Extreme screen sizes
- Loading states
- JavaScript disabled
- Deep linking

✅ **Clear scope boundaries**: "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists 8 items not included in this feature to prevent scope creep.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions**: Dedicated "Assumptions" section lists 8 assumptions about existing infrastructure and user preferences.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each functional requirement is independently testable and maps to user stories.

✅ **Primary flows covered**: User stories cover the complete user journey:
- P1: Basic navigation (foundation)
- P2: Feature integration (connecting to existing functionality)
- P2: Mobile responsiveness (accessibility)
- P3: Enhanced desktop experience (optimization)

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: Success criteria provide concrete metrics for verifying feature success across performance, usability, and accessibility dimensions.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout. Terms like "panel," "overlay," "toggle," and "animation" describe user-facing behavior, not implementation details.

## Notes

All checklist items passed on first validation. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` commands.

**Key Strengths**:
- Well-prioritized user stories with clear MVP (P1) identification
- Comprehensive edge case analysis
- Strong success criteria with quantifiable metrics
- Clear scope boundaries preventing feature creep

**Ready for next phase**: ✅ Yes
