# Tasks: AI-Powered Virtual Outfit Change

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-ai-outfit-change/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: NOT included (not explicitly requested in feature specification)

**Storage Strategy**: For MVP (US1, US2, US3), use local file storage instead of ÈòøÈáå‰∫ë OSS to accelerate development. OSS integration can be added later in US5 or polish phase.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Backend**: `server/src/`
- **Frontend**: `client/src/`
- **Database**: `server/prisma/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and dependency installation

- [x] T001 Install backend dependencies: `@google/generative-ai`, `bull`, `@nestjs/bull`, `sharp`, `file-type`, `multer`, `@nestjs/platform-express` in server/package.json
- [x] T002 [P] Install frontend dependencies (if needed) in client/package.json
- [x] T003 [P] Configure environment variables in server/.env: GEMINI_API_KEY, REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT, UPLOAD_DIR (for local storage)
- [x] T004 [P] Add example environment variables to server/.env.example

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Try Different Outfits (Priority: P2)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 4 should work - users can try multiple outfits sequentially

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Manage Saved Images (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable users to view saved images across sessions and delete items they no longer need

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1(P1) ‚Üí US3(P1) ‚Üí US2(P2) ‚Üí US4(P2) ‚Üí US5(P3)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1 but logically follows
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1 and US2 for full user flow but can be developed independently
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US3 but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent enhancement

### Within Each User Story

- DTOs before endpoints
- Service methods before controller endpoints
- Backend endpoints before frontend API client
- API client before components
- Components before page integration
- Core implementation before error handling

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Phase 1 (Setup)
```bash
# All setup tasks can run in parallel:
T002 (frontend deps) || T003 (env vars) || T004 (.env.example)
```

#### Phase 2 (Foundational)
```bash
# After Prisma setup (T005-T007), all service creation can run in parallel:
T008 (module) || T009 (controller) || T010 (service) || T011 (storage service) || T012 (gemini service)
```

#### Phase 3 (User Story 1)
```bash
# DTOs in parallel:
T021 (upload-model.dto) || T022 (confirm-upload-model.dto)

# Frontend components in parallel:
T030 (ModelUpload component) || T031 (API client) || T032 (useImageUpload hook)
```

#### Phase 4 (User Story 2)
```bash
# DTOs in parallel:
T037 (upload-clothing.dto) || T038 (confirm-upload-clothing.dto)

# Frontend components in parallel:
T045 (ClothingUpload) || T046 (ClothingGallery)
```

#### Phase 5 (User Story 3)
```bash
# Frontend components in parallel:
T063 (LoadingOverlay) || T064 (ResultDisplay) || T065 (useOutfitProcessing hook)
```

#### Phase 7 (User Story 5)
```bash
# All deletion endpoints in parallel:
T082 (DELETE models) || T084 (DELETE clothing) || T086 (DELETE results)
```

#### Phase 8 (Polish)
```bash
# Most polish tasks can run in parallel:
T097 (rate limiting) || T098 (Gemini errors) || T099 (OSS errors) || T100 (optimization) || T101 (logging) || T102 (types) || T103 (responsive) || T104 (lazy loading)
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Step 1: Create DTOs in parallel
Task: "Create upload-model.dto.ts with RequestUploadUrlDto in server/src/modules/outfit-change/dto/"
Task: "Create confirm-upload-model.dto.ts with ConfirmModelUploadDto in server/src/modules/outfit-change/dto/"

# Step 2: After backend endpoints complete, create frontend components in parallel
Task: "Create ModelUpload component with drag-and-drop area in client/src/components/OutfitChange/ModelUpload.tsx"
Task: "Create outfit-change API client with uploadModel() function in client/src/api/outfit-change.ts"
Task: "Create useImageUpload custom hook in client/src/hooks/useImageUpload.ts"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Upload Model Photo)
4. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (AI Outfit Change)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test core flow - upload model, upload one clothing item, perform AI outfit change
6. Deploy/demo if ready - this is the minimum viable product!

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users can upload models
3. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Core AI outfit change works (MVP!)
4. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users can build clothing collections
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Sequential outfit trying
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Image management
7. Add Polish ‚Üí Final production-ready version

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Upload Model)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Upload Clothing)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (AI Processing) - depends on A & B for integration
3. Developer A moves to User Story 5 after completing US1
4. Developer B moves to User Story 4 after completing US2
5. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All API endpoints require JWT authentication (handled by existing auth module)
- All database queries must filter by userId for security
- Use soft deletes (deletedAt) for user-facing data
- Gemini API key must be kept secure in environment variables
- **Local storage for MVP**: Images stored in server/uploads/ directory (ÈòøÈáå‰∫ë OSS integration deferred to later phase)

---

## Total Task Count

- **Setup**: 5 tasks
- **Foundational**: 16 tasks
- **User Story 1**: 13 tasks
- **User Story 2**: 11 tasks
- **User Story 3**: 23 tasks
- **User Story 4**: 8 tasks
- **User Story 5**: 15 tasks
- **Polish**: 11 tasks
- **TOTAL**: 102 tasks

## Parallel Opportunities Identified

- Phase 1: 4 parallel tasks
- Phase 2: 5 parallel tasks
- Phase 3 (US1): 5 parallel tasks
- Phase 4 (US2): 4 parallel tasks
- Phase 5 (US3): 4 parallel tasks
- Phase 7 (US5): 3 parallel tasks
- Phase 8: 8 parallel tasks
- **TOTAL**: 33 parallelizable tasks

## Independent Test Criteria

- **US1**: Upload model photo ‚Üí displays in center area
- **US2**: Upload clothing items ‚Üí appear as thumbnails in sidebar
- **US3**: Click clothing ‚Üí loading indicator ‚Üí AI result displays
- **US4**: Click different clothing ‚Üí new result replaces previous
- **US5**: Images persist across sessions, can be deleted

## Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product** = Setup + Foundational + User Story 1 + User Story 2 + User Story 3
- Users can upload a model photo (US1: 13 tasks)
- Users can upload clothing items (US2: 11 tasks)
- Users can perform AI outfit change and see the result (US3: 23 tasks)
- Uses local file storage for rapid development
- Total: ~68 tasks (Setup 5 + Foundational 16 + US1 13 + US2 11 + US3 23)
- This delivers the complete core value proposition without cloud storage complexity
- ÈòøÈáå‰∫ë OSS integration can be added later in US5 or polish phase
