# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Virtual Outfit Change

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-outfit-change`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "实现一个一键换装的功能,核心流程是用户登录到首页之后,居中的位置上传一张模特的照片,然后右侧的操作栏可以上传多张衣服图片,点击其中一张之后,使用 gemini-2.5-flash-preview 大模型去实现衣服换装,换装过程中有loading提示,其他操作不可用"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Upload Model Photo (Priority: P1)

A user wants to upload a photo of a person (model) to try on different outfits virtually. After logging in, they see the home page with a prominent upload area in the center where they can select and upload their model photo.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational step for the entire feature. Without uploading a model photo, no outfit changes can be performed. It delivers immediate value by allowing users to prepare their base image for virtual try-on.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in, navigating to the home page, and successfully uploading a model photo. Success is verified when the photo displays in the center area and the system accepts the upload.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user on the home page, **When** they click the center upload area, **Then** a file selection dialog appears
2. **Given** the file dialog is open, **When** the user selects a valid image file (JPEG, PNG), **Then** the image uploads and displays in the center area
3. **Given** a model photo is uploaded, **When** the user wants to change it, **Then** they can upload a different photo to replace the current one

### User Story 2 - Upload Clothing Images (Priority: P2)

A user wants to upload multiple clothing items they wish to virtually try on the model. They use the right sidebar to upload one or more clothing images, creating a gallery of options to choose from.

**Why this priority**: This enables users to build their wardrobe collection for virtual try-on. It's the second essential step that prepares the clothing options before the AI processing begins.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading a model photo (from Story 1), then using the right sidebar to upload multiple clothing images. Success is verified when all clothing images appear in the right panel as selectable options.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a model photo is uploaded, **When** the user clicks the upload button in the right sidebar, **Then** a file selection dialog appears
2. **Given** the file dialog is open, **When** the user selects one or more clothing images, **Then** all selected images appear as thumbnails in the right sidebar
3. **Given** multiple clothing items are uploaded, **When** the user reviews them, **Then** each item is clearly visible and distinguishable

---

### User Story 3 - Perform AI Outfit Change (Priority: P1)

A user wants to see how a specific clothing item looks on their uploaded model. They click on one of the clothing images in the right sidebar, triggering an AI-powered outfit change process that generates a new image showing the model wearing the selected clothing.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the feature. It's what users came to accomplish and delivers the primary benefit of virtual try-on technology.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a model photo and at least one clothing image uploaded, then clicking the clothing item. Success is verified when the AI processing completes and displays a new image showing the outfit change.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a model photo and clothing items are uploaded, **When** the user clicks a clothing item, **Then** the system displays a loading indicator
2. **Given** AI processing has started, **When** processing is in progress, **Then** all user interactions are disabled (uploads, clicking other items)
3. **Given** AI processing completes successfully, **When** results are ready, **Then** the center area displays the new image with the outfit change applied
4. **Given** processing completes, **When** the result is displayed, **Then** the loading indicator disappears and interactions are re-enabled

---

### User Story 4 - Try Different Outfits (Priority: P2)

A user wants to try multiple different clothing items on the same model to compare options. After one outfit change completes, they can click another clothing item to see a different look.

**Why this priority**: This enhances the comparison and decision-making process, allowing users to explore multiple options without re-uploading the model photo.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing one outfit change, then clicking a different clothing item to trigger another AI processing cycle. Success is verified when multiple outfit variations can be generated sequentially.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an outfit change has completed, **When** the user clicks a different clothing item, **Then** a new AI processing cycle begins
2. **Given** multiple outfit changes have been performed, **When** the user reviews results, **Then** the most recent result is always displayed in the center

---

### User Story 5 - Manage Saved Images (Priority: P3)

A user wants to manage their collection of saved images (model photos and clothing items). They can view all their previously uploaded images when they return to the application, and delete items they no longer need.

**Why this priority**: This is an enhancement that improves the long-term user experience by allowing users to organize their saved content. It's lower priority than the core try-on functionality but important for users who will use the feature regularly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by uploading images in one session, logging out, logging back in, and verifying that saved images are displayed. Also test the deletion functionality. Success is verified when images persist across sessions and can be removed when desired.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has uploaded images in a previous session, **When** they log in again, **Then** all their saved model photos and clothing items are displayed
2. **Given** saved images are displayed, **When** the user wants to remove an image, **Then** they can delete it from their account
3. **Given** a user deletes an image, **When** the deletion completes, **Then** the image is removed from the display and permanently deleted from their account

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user uploads an invalid file format (not an image)?
- What happens if the model photo doesn't contain a clear human figure?
- What happens if the clothing image is unclear or doesn't show the garment properly?
- How does the system handle AI processing failures or timeouts?
- What happens if the user tries to upload extremely large image files?
- What happens if the user closes the browser/tab during AI processing?
- What happens if the user has a slow internet connection and uploads take a long time?
- What happens when the AI service (Gemini) is unavailable or rate-limited?
